# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

It is an AJAX-based app that uses jQuery, HTML5 and CSS. The app lets the user post tweets to a Tweet feed, while dynamically updating the page.

## Key Features

- Create a tweet and post it with the tweet button! Watch tweets update dynamically in chronological order.

- Appropriate error messages will inform the user if a tweet does not meet the correct standard.

- Open and close the tweet composer with the "Write a new tweet" button.

- When the tweet composer is out of view, click the blue arrow button that appears to slide back to the composer!

- Responsive layout that makes the app usable for phones, tablets, and desktop!
